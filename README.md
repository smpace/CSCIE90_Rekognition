# CSCIE90_Rekognition
Simple test code for AWS Rekognition

Original code from https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples
I have made edits to rekognition_video_detection.py in order to streamline the process of running the tests to better demonstrate some of the capabilities of AWS Rekognition.
